      "Indirect taxes contribute extensively to the government revenue and in recent years indirect tax collection has exceeded the direct tax incomes. With the integration of various indirect taxes in to GST, the collection is expected to go up further. India being a federal country, we have adopted dual GST with a four rate structure to meet the interests of various states. Given that the government is extremely proactive in addressing the transition challenges faced by trade and industry, a number of exemptions and concessions find place in the evolving GST system.",

          "Goods and Services Tax (GST) is among the big tax reforms introduced in the history of the Indian fiscal evolution. In addition to the exceptional impact GST has on the economic growth of the country and the way business is done in India, it has achieved the following:Converted India into one common market by seamless flow of tax credits – in the earlier regime some taxes were not creditable when goods moved from one state to another, excise/service tax credit was not available to a trader and a services unit could not claim credit of Value Added Tax (VAT) paid on goods. Multiple indirect tax laws replaced by a singular uniform tax regime making compliance easier across the country. Number of slab rates reduced substantially making life easier and disputes reduced.          Compliance process became uniform across the country due to one common IT portal where businesses and government agencies interact – this has reduced human interaction and brought transparency in the administration. Business decisions may not be driven by tax considerations any more, as most of the taxes are creditable, bringing in overall efficiency in business operations spurring economic growth. Electronic filing and online credit matching has substantially reduced non-compliance and tax frauds – this is providing significant boost to honest businesses.",
